My interest was piqued since I hadn’t played around with my equipment in a while, so I started writing up a post of my own in order to join the fra... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Making Red Teaming Safer</title><link href="/posts/Making-Red-Teaming-Safer/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Making Red Teaming Safer" /><published>2024-02-15T00:00:00+00:00</published> <updated>2024-02-15T19:34:33+00:00</updated> <id>/posts/Making-Red-Teaming-Safer/</id> <content src="/posts/Making-Red-Teaming-Safer/" /> <author> <name>Matt Culbert</name> </author> <summary> I have been quietly hard at work the past few months turning an old project that didn’t quite work even half the time into a framework that provides the solid base of functionality required to build something much larger off of. But first, some background. Last year, I made a post about designing a red team framework. It was the offshoot of a Vault 7 project I made in Python and the first one... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Subdomain Takeovers</title><link href="/posts/Subdomain-Takeovers/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Subdomain Takeovers" /><published>2023-12-08T00:00:00+00:00</published> <updated>2023-12-08T00:00:00+00:00</updated> <id>/posts/Subdomain-Takeovers/</id> <content src="/posts/Subdomain-Takeovers/" /> <author> <name>Matt Culbert</name> </author> <summary> A quick story of a misconfiguration This is a very quick post, I’m working on others I promise. On Dec 8, I went to my site, git.culbertreport.com, and all looked good. I then went to cr.culbertreport.com to try and fix an issue with that returning a 404 and I found a crypto site. I’m not going to lie, I kinda panicked for a minute. What happened, was my Cloudflare hacked, how I have 2fa, w... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>The Evolution Of Evasion</title><link href="/posts/The-evolution-of-evasion/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Evolution Of Evasion" /><published>2023-08-20T00:00:00+00:00</published> <updated>2023-08-22T19:35:33+00:00</updated> <id>/posts/The-evolution-of-evasion/</id> <content src="/posts/The-evolution-of-evasion/" /> <author> <name>Matt Culbert</name> </author> <summary> The evolution of evasion Evasion is a very interesting topic. When I say evasion, I’m referring to both evading prying eyes from analysts and avoiding their attention, as well as evading AV and EDR. We can see how espionage operations in 2000 led to advancements in EDR and OS mitigations today in 2023. The Equation Group is fascinating to study in this area because for so long their operations... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>C2 Smackdown Empire Vs Mythic</title><link href="/posts/C2-Smackdown-Empire-vs-Mythic/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="C2 Smackdown Empire Vs Mythic" /><published>2023-07-20T00:00:00+00:00</published> <updated>2023-07-20T21:17:17+00:00</updated> <id>/posts/C2-Smackdown-Empire-vs-Mythic/</id> <content src="/posts/C2-Smackdown-Empire-vs-Mythic/" /> <author> <name>Matt Culbert</name> </author> <summary> C2 Smackdown - Empire vs Mythic I found evaluating platforms like this to be a great way to familiarize myself with them quickly, so I’ve opted to do this test again. The last time I compared C2’s, it was Havoc vs Sliver, and Sliver came out on top because they simply had more resources that they could dedicate to development and expansion. But Havoc was impressive for what it was, a Cobalt St... </summary> </entry> </feed>
